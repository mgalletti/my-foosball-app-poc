# Development Guide

## Application Overview

This is a **Foosball Tournament Management System** - a web application for organizing and tracking foosball games, challenges, and player statistics. The app manages players, venues, game scheduling, and tournament results.

## Technology Stack Rationale

### Node.js & Express.js for Backend

**Node.js** is ideal for this application because:
- **Event-driven architecture** handles multiple concurrent game requests efficiently
- **JavaScript ecosystem** provides extensive libraries for web development
- **Fast development cycle** with hot-reloading and rapid prototyping
- **JSON-native** processing perfect for REST APIs
- **Single language** across frontend and backend reduces context switching

**Express.js** complements Node.js by providing:
- **Minimal and flexible** web framework with essential features
- **Middleware ecosystem** for authentication, validation, and logging
- **RESTful API** development with clean routing
- **Large community** and extensive documentation
- **Performance** suitable for real-time game updates

### TypeScript over JavaScript

**TypeScript** advantages:
- **Type safety** prevents runtime errors in game logic and data handling
- **Better IDE support** with autocomplete and refactoring
- **Scalability** as the codebase grows with more features
- **Interface definitions** ensure consistent data structures across layers
- **Compile-time error detection** catches bugs before deployment

## Libraries and Dependencies

### Core Dependencies
- **express** - Web framework for REST API endpoints
- **zod** - Schema validation for request/response data
- **mongoose** - MongoDB ODM for data persistence
- **dynamoose** - DynamoDB ODM for AWS deployment option


## API Interfaces 

### Zod - validation and sere

Zod has been chosed over other libraries because it offers a developer-friendly, fully type-safe, and composable way to handle both validation and serialization/deserialization of API requests and responses. Zod aligns well with TypeScript's type inference system and simplifies keeping your runtime validation and static types in sync.

#### Pros:

1. Strong Type Inference: Automatically infers TypeScript types from schemas.
1. Lightweight and Fast: Minimal runtime overhead, no external dependencies.
1. Built-in Transformations: Easily convert validated data to internal models.
1. Composable: Reuse and extend schemas cleanly.
1. Great DX: Clear errors, simple API, rich ecosystem.

#### Cons:

1. Fewer decorators: Not decorator-based like class-validator (may not fit OOP style).
1. Slightly verbose for deeply nested schemas compared to class-based validation.

## Architecture Patterns

- **Repository Pattern** - Abstracts data access with adapters for different databases
- **Service Layer** - Business logic separation from controllers
- **DTO Pattern** - Data validation and transfer objects
- **Dependency Injection** - Loose coupling between components

## Database Flexibility

The application supports multiple database backends through the adapter pattern:
- **In-Memory** - For testing and development
- **MongoDB** - Document-based storage for flexible schemas
- **DynamoDB** - Serverless NoSQL for AWS deployments
